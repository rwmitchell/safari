'open_command' is simplified version of same from 'web-search' plugin,
but it replaces the use of Apple's 'open' with 'safari'.  Code for
other OSes removed has Safari only runs on MacOS.

A full URL is required, with leading http:// or https://

Used in combination with 'web-search' plugin, 'google' will
use 'safari' instead of 'open' to display the search.
